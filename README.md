## Introduction
We are excited to welcome you to the SvelteKit Fundamentals course, a key part of the Summer Internship Program 2024. In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of SvelteKit by building an Instagram clone.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the current repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch with your name.
4. Implement the app by following the tutorial.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

### Additional Challenge
Develop an image viewer and photo filter editor using HTML5 canvas. This setup should allow users to preview the uploaded image, and then apply basic filters like grayscale or sepia.

This challenge is designed to push your skills further and give you hands-on experience with a more complex application feature.
